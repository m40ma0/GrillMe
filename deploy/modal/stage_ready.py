"""Stage Ready (web, realtime, worker and Redis) as one Modal web app, on CPU.

Deploy from the repo root, with the code you have checked out:
    modal deploy deploy/modal/stage_ready.py

Settings come from the Modal secret "stage-ready-app" (see docs/deploy.md). The app is served at
https://<workspace>--stage-ready.modal.run; set PUBLIC_HOST in the secret to that host name.

One container at most: Redis and live rehearsal sessions are in its memory. During the judging window
one container stays warm (no cold start); after judging, deploy with KEEP_WARM=0 so it scales to zero
after 20 idle minutes and only uses credits while in use.

Every page makes several Postgres round trips, so run the container next to the database: set
MODAL_REGION at deploy time to the Modal region nearest your Postgres host (e.g. "us-east" for Neon
us-east-1/us-east-2, "us-west" for us-west-2, "eu-west" for eu-central-1/eu-west, "ap-southeast" for
ap-southeast-1). Pinning a region can carry a price multiplier on Modal; see docs/deploy.md.
